This code was changed from another creator's code.
You can use this code to perform classification tasks for CIFAR-10 datasets based on the pytorh architecture.
Dataset download is included.
Of course, an optional network option is available.
including 'LeNet5', 'AlexNet', 'VGG16', 'VGG19', 'ResNet18', 'ResNet34','DenseNet', 'MobileNetv1', 'MobileNetv2'. 
You can train to get a loss acc lr image And finally print out the results of each round of training and testing Finally, 
the trained model is saved and used for final testing.
The test sample is from a cat.The test displays the predicted category results.
The code still has some bugs and deficiencies that still need to be improved.
Include the training code：train.py forecast code：pre.py Data preprocessing and downloading code：dataloader.
